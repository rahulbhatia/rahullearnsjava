# Rahul Learns Java Repository

When learning a new language (even one as familiar as Java) it helps to focus on solving actual problems with the language. To that end, I use this repository to store a series of projects that use the java language to accomplish certain tasks, some more trivial than others. 

## Projects
  - Hello World - Standard Hello World project in Java
  - transformations - String & file manipulation
